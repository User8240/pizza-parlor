## Tests


**Describe:** _Pizza();_


**Test:** _It will use the Pizza constructor to create Pizza object(s) containing these properties: toppings and size_  

Code: _let myPizza = new Pizza("Cheese", "Regular");_  
      _myPizza;_  

Expected Output: _Pizza {toppings: 'Cheese', size: 'Regular'}_  

**Test:** _It will create a predefined list of topping and size for each property; It'll include the list as another object inside of toppings and size_  

Code: _let allToppings = {toppings: ["extraCheese", "Peperoni"], size: ["Regular", "Large"]};_  
_allToppings.toppings;_  
_allToppings.size;_  

Expected Output: _allToppings;_  
_{toppings: Array(2), size: Array(3)}_  
 _allToppings.toppings_  
_(2) ['extraCheese', 'Peperoni']_  
_allToppings.size_  
_(3) ['Regular', 'Large']_
